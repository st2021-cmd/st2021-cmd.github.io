          <p>Currently I have a stack of mostly thesis-related books with a couple of extra thrown in.
            I'm writing on Google Street View as a medium and how two artists, Jon Rafman and Michael Wolf,
            use it in their own practices. I don't know right now I hate talking about my thesis. It's all consuming right now and the last thing that I want right now is to give it more mental space when it's already eaten so much.
            I've started saying Google Street View when I mean other things. Sometimes I absentmindedly type it in when trying to go somewhere. But anyway, that's what most of these books are for, my thesis. I got some stuff on map-making,
            (Cartography by Matthew Edney, Time for Mapping edited by Lammes et al.), some stuff on digital art (
            Evil Media by Fuller and Goffey, Digital Uncanny by Ravetto, The Immersive Internet edited by Tiegland and Power),
            I was originally going to talk about creepypastas so I got some books on that (Slender Man is Coming by Blank and McNeill),
            and then I got some other books (The Art of Gathering by Parker which Laurel gave us and Mug Meals by Cheney because
            I'm basically cooking with microwave these days).</p>

        I made this during that weird week before we started school when everyone was moving in. I meant to use it
        as a way to encourage me to work out. I had lost maybe 10 - 15 lbs before the pandemic and was really healthy and
        working out everyday and eating well and I felt so good... Then I came back to school and lost all incentive and gained
        it all back and now I'm obese again (I mean this very literally in the medical-diagnosis-because-doctors way). The
        stars represent days I've worked out.<br><br>
        I made this with watercolor, watercolors I'm supposed to be using for my VIS thesis show, but I miss making art just for me and not for some bigger project. It doesn't feel meditative anymore. But this did.<br>
        Another thing that kinda sucked about moving in was that it was right before my boyfriend's birthday. I'm kind of
        worried about him because he's home alone right now and he's a hyper-extroverted person so... idk. Also it was our anniversary soon after
        too, but it was fine. We facetimed and watched anime so it was something at least?

        I kind of feel like I cheated with my stickers? The last laptop I had had so many stickers that I collected throughout the years. But this
        one... I bought a lot on redbubble. I don't know why it feels like cheating... but I like the stickers so what does it matter? Also they are
        representative of who I am and the experiences I've had... they just didn't necessarily come into my posession during those experiences... maybe
        that's why it feels like cheating.

        I have a shit load of hair right now. I decided not to cut it until the pandemic ended. I decided this last year. I regret this decission
        but I am too stuborn. My hair is down to the waist of my jeans now and it's heavy... really really heavy. <br><br>
        I'm a little obsessed with my hair but I think it's because my grandparents are too. I'm the only ginger grand child and they're thankful that this gene specifically is getting passed on. I joke that I want to marry someone else ginger and create a ginger clan but I'm not sure it's a joke anymore.

        I added some stickers to my iPad, but it looks super bland still. Even though
        my iPad is basically the most important tool I have in my possession right now
        it's just not very pretty. I use it all the time to draw, my VIS advisors last year
        weren't thrilled with that. My VIS advisors this year aren't thrilled with it either. I
        kind of caved in and moved to paper and charcoal. It's kind of dumb because if I'm going
        to do digital art it should be this year, right?

        It's just a lamp. It's funny, I have it pointed at my white wall because
        it lights up more of the room that way. Otherwise it's too bright. I should probably
        sell it or give it away this year when I leave... Ew I'm a senior.

        Okay I promise the only reason it's dirty is because of charcoal. I probably shouldn't
        wear my light-colored masks to my studio when I do art because after one session they look like this.
        I need to wash it really badly AGAIN. I feel like I have to wash it everyday.

        It's just my monitor. I watch anime on it sometimes with my boyfriend (via zoom, he's in the city right now.)
        To be honest I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I guess I've started to like it because of him. He's a Japanese Studies major at Columbia
        so he can get a little... annoying about anime. Sometimes I just want to be lazy on put on dubs so I can watch while drawing,
        he thinks that subs are bad. He's also fluent in Japanese so it's not like subtitles are a thing for him. I don't mind subtitles in
        shows, I just can't draw to them.

        I got this as a 'gift' in white elephant during Thanksgiving. My aunt put this mug in the pile. Apparently this is my uncle's mug and
        he was not aware that Rachel had taken it. He wants it back but nah, it's mine now. Mwahahaha. It's honestly my favorite mug though, although
        I think part of the reason for that is because I know my uncle wants it back. It's a little evil but my family's sense of humor is a little evil.

        I got this for Christmas in 2020. It's a nitro-coldbrew maker. It's honestly the coolest thing
        I own. The instructions aren't great, if followed it makes super weak coffee, but I have saved so much money with this
        thing. Lmao this sounds like an ad. I really wish I could have people in my room right now and make nitro-coldbrew for them. Honestly the biggest obstacle to having people in my room is the fact that I'm on the 4th floor, not COVID.

        wanted to keep the old photo? It feels wrong to have a prox photo that looks good.

        His name is butthole. I got him when I was twelve. I thought I was hilarious. <br><br>
        To be fair he does have a literal, sewn on butthole.
        I got it from Kid Robot, this store in SoHo (for those who don't know it's a neighborhood in lower manhattan that's mainly shopping).
        It was this weird, over-priced collectable toy store that everyone at my school was obsessed with. It was insanely popular for awhile.
        It closed in 2016 or something like that, maybe earlier. I can't believe I spent $5 on a keychain... multiple times.

        I never drank redbull or really any energy drink (besides coffee) until I came to Princeton.
        Even then, I never drank them outside of reading period or finals. Now I drink them at least once a
        week because of my thesis. The only one I like the taste of is the coconut one which always has so
        many more cans available than the other flavors so I wonder if everyone else hates them? I get weirdly
        paranoid about the fact that maybe I like something I shouldn't like which should <i>not</i> be my thought process
        but I'm an insecure moron so who knows.
