        These are, or were, my favorite glasses. I feel like I can never find light-colored glasses and these were just so nice. <br><br>
        They were on the floor and because I'm basically blind and because they're lightly colored I didn't see them and I just stomped on them.
        The frames aren't sold anymore, I guess I just have to super glue it. It'll hopefully be okay. I'm just weirdly attached to these glasses.

        Anyone who has thighs that touch know the pain that is thigh chafing. This is basically
        why I hate the summer. It sometimes feels impossible to wear shorts because I just can't stop worrying about my thighs. Maybe I wouldn't mind
        the summer so much if thigh chafing didn't make it so incredibly painful to walk. This helps, but it's not perfect like anything else. I mostly just wear long dresses and pants
        because sometimes I feel like I really can't wear shorts. <br><br>
        This is probably the biggest motivation I have for losing weight, so that I'm not in physical pain during warmer weather.

        I love this thing but I realized I mostly wear it when I want to look pretty or feel insecure.
        Like it's really light and fool-proof to apply and makes my skin looked airbrushed-ish and I like it? It also
        has sunscreen and I literally burn during the winter while indoors.

        I originally got this as a notebook for my classes Spring 2020. Didn't really
        need a notebook once I got home so I started logging what I ate in it because my doctors
        asked me to. It was useful when I was in a good mindset. But it's hard to consistenly be in a
        good mindset especially with my insecurities so I needed to stop for a bit. I need to learn
        how to meditate on what I've eaten without focusing on calories. I figured it out recently, but
        I don't want to log anything right now while a write my thesis because I need to cut myself some
        slack.

        The prescription for these is half of what I need. I'm about -2.50? These are -1.25 so they're not very useful. I really need to update these.

        I got this Fall 2019 when I was too scared to leave my room. I don't mean this figuratively. I had so much anxiety surrounding food and eating clubs. <br><br>
        I'm in Tower, but I also have immense social anxiety so maybe joining this club was <i>not</i> the smartest decision. I just wanted to eat with my friends. It got to the point where I wouldn't get food because I was too
        afraid to eat in public. The anxiety was really bad so I got prescribed this. <br><br>
        I wish that food and social groups were not so closely linked. I wish I could just get food by myself and not even think about it. Quarantine was probably one of the best things to happen to me for my anxiety.

        This is how I oragnize my meds. I take too many per day for me to actually remember.

        recenetly has been trying to get me on less. I've told her that I don't <i>like</i> being on meds but that most of these are incredibly helpful and I need them right now. Trying to eliminate them is not the goal, trying to be healthier is.

        I was told by my therapist that a lot of golfers take this med. I don't think
        I've ever actually taken it (don't worry, it's a take as needed type of deal). It makes you stop shaking apparently? My other meds make me shake though so it seems kind of dumb to take another med to counteract the first ones.
